  ARTHUR:  Whoa there!
      [clop clop]

  GUARD #1:  Halt!  Who goes there?
  ARTHUR:  It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle
      of Camelot.  King of the Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign
      of all England!
  GUARD #1:  Pull the other one!
  ARTHUR:  I am.  And this my trusty servant Patsy.
      We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights
      who will join me in my court of Camelot.  I must speak with your lord
      and master.
  GUARD #1:  What, ridden on a horse?
  ARTHUR:  Yes!
  GUARD #1:  You're using coconuts!
  ARTHUR:  What?
  GUARD #1:  You've got two empty halves of coconut and you're bangin'
      'em together.
  ARTHUR:  So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this
      land, through the kingdom of Mercea, through--
  GUARD #1:  Where'd you get the coconut?
  ARTHUR:  We found them.
  GUARD #1:  Found them?  In Mercea?  The coconut's tropical!
  ARTHUR:  What do you mean?
  GUARD #1:  Well, this is a temperate zone.
  ARTHUR:  The swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin
      or the plumber may seek warmer climes in winter yet these are not
      strangers to our land.
  GUARD #1:  Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
  ARTHUR:  Not at all, they could be carried.
  GUARD #1:  What -- a swallow carrying a coconut?
  ARTHUR:  It could grip it by the husk!
  GUARD #1:  It's not a question of where he grips it!  It's a simple
      question of weight ratios!  A five ounce bird could not carry a 1 pound
      coconut.
  ARTHUR:  Well, it doesn't matter.  Will you go and tell your master
      that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
  GUARD #1:  Listen, in order to maintain air-speed velocity, a swallow
      needs to beat its wings 43 times every second, right?
  ARTHUR:  Please!
  GUARD #1:  Am I right?
  ARTHUR:  I'm not interested!
  GUARD #2:  It could be carried by an African swallow!
  GUARD #1:  Oh, yeah, an African swallow maybe, but not a European
      swallow, that's my point.
  GUARD #2:  Oh, yeah, I agree with that...
  ARTHUR:  Will you ask your master if he wants to join my court
      at Camelot?!
  GUARD #1:  But then of course African swallows are not migratory.
  GUARD #2:  Oh, yeah...
  GUARD #1:  So they couldn't bring a coconut back anyway...
      [clop clop]
  GUARD #2:  Wait a minute -- supposing two swallows carried it together?
  GUARD #1:  No, they'd have to have it on a line.
  GUARD #2:  Well, simple!  They'd just use a standard creeper!
  GUARD #1:  What, held under the dorsal guiding feathers?
  GUARD #2:  Well, why not?
