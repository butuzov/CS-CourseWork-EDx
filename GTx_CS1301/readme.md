# Georgia Tech CS1301

You would find any problems sets after data structures (unit 4), becouse I have droped out after get passing grades. Course is Good for absolute beginers (not only in Python but in Programming), however it has a LOT of issues with a quality of content and multiple erros, etc...

However, thanks Prof Joyner and Georgia Tech for a free course!
