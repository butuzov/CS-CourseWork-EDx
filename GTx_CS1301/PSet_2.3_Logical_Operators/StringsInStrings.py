#The 'in' operator can be used to see if a string of characters
#is found within another string of characters, just like it can
#be used to find if an item is in a list.
#
#Below we create five strings. For each string, print whether or
#not the substring "world" is found within that string.

string1 = "Hello, world!"
string2 = "Hello, earth!"
string3 = "HELLO, WORLD!"
string4 = "Hi, world!"
string5 = "Salutations, third planet from the sun!"

#Do not modify the lines of code above!

#Print whether 'world' is in string1
print( 'world' in string1 )
#Print whether 'world' is in string2
print( 'world' in string2 )
#Print whether 'world' is in string3
print( 'world' in string3 )
#Print whether 'world' is in string4
print( 'world' in string4 )
#Print whether 'world' is in string5
print( 'world' in string5 )
