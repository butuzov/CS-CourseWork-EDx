#Remember, greater than and less than operators can be used to
#compare strings. A string is "less than" another string if it
#comes earlier when sorted alphabetically.
#
#This can have some nuances, though, when it comes to
#capitalization, punctuation, and spaces.
#
#In the code below, we've created seven strings. For each string,
#check to see if it would be considered earlier than the next
#string or later. Print 'True' if the first string is earlier
#alphabetically than the second string, 'False' otherwise.
#These values should come from comparing the variables in your
#code, not from performing the comparisons yourself and just
#printing the results directly.

string1 = "grapes"
string2 = "Apples"
string3 = "Apples and grapes"
string4 = "Apples."
string5 = "Applesauce."
string6 = " Applesauce."
string7 = ""

#Do not modify the code above!

#Print the result of seeing if string1 comes before string2.
print( string1 < string2);
#Print the result of seeing if string2 comes before string3.
print( string2 < string3);
#Print the result of seeing if string3 comes before string4.
print( string3 < string4);
#Print the result of seeing if string4 comes before string5.
print( string4 < string5);
#Print the result of seeing if string5 comes before string6.
print( string5 < string6);
#Print the result of seeing if string6 comes before string7.
print( string6 < string7);
